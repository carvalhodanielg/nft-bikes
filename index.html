                <h1>Collection Launch</h1>
                <p><span>From the beginning, the idea behind the project was to create a very high end collection of NFTs. 
                    The bikes are procedurally generated, and fully 3D, but we're actually working super hard to ensure 
                    each of them has the quality stamp when it comes out of the factory. As quality is our main driver, 
                    of course it takes time.</span> The project started at the end of the summer, and if everything goes 
                    according to the plan, we're aiming for a release on the 10th of January.
